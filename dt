Machine Learning is undeniably one of the most influential and powerful technologies in today’s world. More importantly, we are far from seeingits full potential. There’s no doubt, it will continue to be making headlines for the foreseeable future. This article is designed as an introduction to the Machine Learning concepts, covering all the fundamental ideas without being too high level.Machine learning is a tool for turning information into knowledge. In the past 50 years, there has been an explosion of data. This mass of data is useless unless we analyse it and find the patterns hidden within. Machine learning techniques are used to automatically find the valuable underlying patterns within complex data that we would otherwise struggle to discover. The hidden patterns andknowledge about a problem can be used to predict future events and perform all kinds of complex decision making.all credits to : gavin edwards towards data science
